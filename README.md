# Finding Donors for CharityML Project 
Udacity Machine learning NanoDegree finding donors project Supervised Learning
In this project, we will use census data to find donor candidates. We will clean and process the data for the supervised learning models, then compare the supervised learning models, refine your chosen model, and identify some of the most important features of your model.
## Overview
In this project, We will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. We will first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, We will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We will then evaluate several supervised learners of our choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, We will optimize the model we've selected and present it as our solution to CharityML. Finally, We will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.
