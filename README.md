# Finding Donors for CharityML Project 
Udacity Machine learning NanoDegree finding donors project Supervised Learning

In this project, we will use census data to find donor candidates. We will clean and process the data for the supervised learning models, then compare the supervised learning models, refine your chosen model, and identify some of the most important features of your model.
